This project uses the core functions of the transperth VB.net project.
Transperth allowed user to type in a start time and dapart and arrival lat longs
and the application would find the best bus route.

This extension is to use the google map API.
1) to display and navigate to the departure and arrival addresses, and place map markers at the 2 points.
2) At the same time read the Lat, longs from google for ths points in VB variables.
3) Calculate the best route as usual.

OR

1) User to type in the addresses and retrieve the lat longs into VB variables.
2) Put markers at the 2 addresses
3) Calculate the best route as usual.

Notes on the google API(s).  From general reading on the net.....
There are several APIs dependiong on which part of the system is being accessed.
We will access the basic map api (to display/interact with the map) and geocode api (to look up the addresses).
The APIs are free (no cost) to access but are controlled by keys.
You have to get a different key for each API accessed.
-----------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Get the keys.
Process is described at https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key
Key    AIzaSyCQST-vb5zP1posC3ttkSxe0TOGaqEg68k for the Places API Web Service
Key    AIzaSyCYRKCPDTTvYcLpTZBj4uX3bcQxRnJJtV0 for Google Maps MAPS API

------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Make script to access the api and display a map
This can be copied verbatim from the various Tutorials and samples in developers.google.com

Step 2a. Add clieck event to place markers

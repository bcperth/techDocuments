Recipe for irish brown soda bread.

NB: PreHeat oven to 200C as first step.
Have a shallow baking tray ready - ie clean and sprinkl with flour.

Mix the following in medium size bowl:
1) 2 eggs (this is optional - perfectly fine without!)
2) 500ml buttermilk (comes in 500ml bottles or 600ml cartons - buy the cheapest)
3) 200ml cream
whisk to creamy consistency in bowl ( 30 secs)

Put the following in separate large mixing bowl
- 400gm of coarse brown flour ( buy Coarse Wholemeal Flour - at shop "All About Bread" at 95 Wannerroo)
  You can use supermarket brown flour if you like - its cheaper - but then add more wheatgerm)
- 200gm of plain white flour through sieve ( no lumps) - NOT self-raising flour
- 1 heaped teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda through sieve ( no lumps) (Mckenzies Bi-Carb Soda - any supermarket)
- 50gm wheatgerm                        (this is optional - except if supermarket brown flour used)
- Desert spoon of brown sugar           (optional - I do not use it)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Mix up the dry ingredients with a wodden spoon for maybe 1 minute -
- especially to make sure the bi-carb is well spread in the mix.

Stir in the liquid contents from the small bowl manually - into the big bowl with the flour.
Mix in well until a sticky wet mass of dough.
- Not liquidy
- Not dry
If too dry - then a dash of milk is fine.
If too wet - add some more brown flour.
(The stirring is quite strenuous - so you a use a Kenwood mixer if you have one).
Mixing should take 1-2 minutes max.

What I do then is this...
Spread some flour on the kitchen workbech - 50cmx50cm
Dump the sticky dough on top of it.
Sprinkle some flour on the dough and hand shape into a rectangle about 5cm high.
Split in two and make 2 round "cake" shapes.

Transfer each cake onto the baking tray - use flour as needed to reduce stickiness.
Shape up a bit with hands and cut a cross on the top so that the bread will "flour".

Put tray in pre-heated oven and bake for 35-40 mins.
When done it will have risen by about 50-60% and taps "hollow" sound.

Take out of oven and place each loaf on a wire rack - to allow air top and bottom.

After that I cut each in 1/2 and put in freezer to use as needed.

Its really simple and hard to go wrong - and you can adjust ingredients at will!
If you like you and missus can come here and I will make a batch so you can see.

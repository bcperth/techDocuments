Prepprocess the stops table to create new columns for stop_lat and stop_lon in radians.
Prepprocess the stops table to create new columns for sin(stop_lat) and cos(stop_lat)
Find all Dep stops within 500m of Dep pos - save the stopIDs and the distances (or walk times assuming walk at 6Km/Hr) 
Find all Dep stops within 500m of Arr pos - save the stipIDs and the distances (or walk times assuming walk at 6Km/Hr)
Use this formula for distance. assume lat1,lon1 is the stop location, and lat2,lon2 is location of starting address.
"dist" =ACOS (Sin(Lat1) *sin(Lat2) +cos(Lat1) *cos(Lat2) *cos(Long1-Long2) ) *6371 in km

depart_stops_list  = select stop_id, "dist" from stops where "dist" < 1000;  for stops near depart
arrive_stops_list  = select stop_id, "dist" from stops where "dist" < 1000;  for stops near arrive 

preprocess stop_times to make an index on each of stop_id and trip_id.

depart_stop_times = select * from stop-times where stop_id IN depart stops_list AND depart_time > start_time + walk_time. 

arrive_stop_times = select * from stop_times where stop_id IN arrive stops AND trip_id IN depart_stop_times
